# validator-registry
Tools for programmatically interacting with the validator registry contract

Note `ValidatorRegistry.go` is the binding of prev contract that was deployed on mev-commit chain, while `ValidatorRegistryV1.go` is the binding of mainnet contract.

`/cmd/store-events` is only relevant for mev-commit chain, while `/cmd/migrate` is only relevant for mainnet.
